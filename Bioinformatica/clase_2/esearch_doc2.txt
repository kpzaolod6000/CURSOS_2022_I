OBJECTIVE: Capillary malformation (CM) occurs sporadically and is associated with
Sturge-Weber syndrome. The somatic mosaic mutation in GNAQ (c.548G>A, p.R183Q) is
enriched in endothelial cells (ECs) in skin CM and Sturge-Weber syndrome brain
CM. Our goal was to investigate how the mutant Gαq (G-protein αq subunit) alters 
EC signaling and disrupts capillary morphogenesis. Approach and Results: We used 
lentiviral constructs to express p.R183Q or wild-type GNAQ in normal human
endothelial colony forming cells (EC-R183Q and EC-WT, respectively). EC-R183Q
constitutively activated PLC (phospholipase C) β3, a downstream effector of Gαq. 
Activated PLCβ3 was also detected in human CM tissue sections. Bulk RNA
sequencing analyses of mutant versus wild-type EC indicated constitutive
activation of PKC (protein kinase C), NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa B) and
calcineurin signaling in EC-R183Q. Increased expression of downstream targets in 
these pathways, ANGPT2 (angiopoietin-2) and DSCR (Down syndrome critical region
protein) 1.4 were confirmed by quantitative PCR and immunostaining of human CM
tissue sections. The Gαq inhibitor YM-254890 as well as siRNA targeted to PLCβ3
reduced mRNA expression levels of these targets in EC-R183Q while the pan-PKC
inhibitor AEB071 reduced ANGPT2 but not DSCR1.4. EC-R183Q formed enlarged blood
vessels in mice, reminiscent of those found in human CM. shRNA knockdown of
ANGPT2 in EC-R183Q normalized the enlarged vessels to sizes comparable those
formed by EC-WT.
CONCLUSIONS: Gαq-R183Q, when expressed in ECs, establishes constitutively active 
PLCβ3 signaling that leads to increased ANGPT2 and a proangiogenic,
proinflammatory phenotype. EC-R183Q are sufficient to form enlarged CM-like
vessels in mice, and suppression of ANGPT2 prevents the enlargement. Our study
provides the first evidence that endothelial Gαq-R183Q is causative for CM and
identifies ANGPT2 as a contributor to CM vascular phenotype.

Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is a neurocutaneous disorder characterized by
vascular malformations affecting skin, eyes and leptomeninges of the brain, which
can lead to glaucoma, seizures and intellectual disability. The discovery of a
disease-causing somatic missense mutation in the GNAQ gene, encoding an alpha
chain of heterotrimeric G-proteins, has initiated efforts to understand how
G-proteins contribute to SWS pathogenesis. The mutation is predominantly detected
in endothelial cells and is currently believed to affect downstream MAPK
signalling. In this study of six Norwegian patients with classical SWS, we aimed 
to identify somatic mutations through deep sequencing of DNA from skin biopsies. 
Surprisingly, one patient was negative for the GNAQ mutation, but instead
harbored a somatic mutation in GNB2 (NM_005273.3:c.232A>G, p.Lys78Glu), which
encodes a beta chain of the same G-protein complex. The positions of the mutant
amino acids in the G-protein are essential for complex reassembly. Therefore,
failure of reassembly and continuous signalling is a likely consequence of both
mutations. Ectopic expression of mutant proteins in endothelial cells revealed
that expression of either mutant reduced cellular proliferation, yet regulated
MAPK signalling differently, suggesting that dysregulated MAPK signalling cannot 
fully explain the SWS phenotype. Instead, both mutants reduced synthesis of
Yes-associated protein (YAP), a transcriptional co-activator of the Hippo
signalling pathway, suggesting a key role for this pathway in the vascular
pathogenesis of SWS. The discovery of the GNB2 mutation sheds novel light on the 
pathogenesis of SWS and suggests that future research on targets of treatment
should be directed towards the YAP, rather than the MAPK, signalling pathway.

BACKGROUND: Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is caused by a somatic mutation in GNAQ
leading to capillary venous malformations in the brain presenting with various
neurological, ophthalmic, and cognitive symptoms of variable severity. This
clinical variability makes accurate prognosis difficult. We hypothesized that the
greater extent of physical factors (extent of skin, eye, and brain involvement), 
presence of possible genetic factors (gender and family history), and age of
seizure onset may be associated with greater symptom severity and need for
surgery in patients with SWS.
METHODS: The questionnaire was collected from 277 participants (age: two months
to 66 years) with SWS brain involvement at seven US sites.
RESULTS: Bilateral brain involvement was associated with both learning disorder
and intellectual disability, whereas port-wine birthmark extent was associated
with epilepsy and an increased likelihood of glaucoma surgery. Subjects with
family history of vascular birthmarks were also more likely to report symptomatic
strokes, and family history of seizures was associated with earlier seizure
onset. Learning disorder, intellectual disability, strokelike episodes,
symptomatic stroke, hemiparesis, visual field deficit, and brain surgery were all
significantly associated with earlier onset of seizures.
CONCLUSION: The extent of brain and skin involvement in SWS, as well as the age
of seizure onset, affect prognosis. Other genetic factors, particularly variants 
involved in vascular development and epilepsy, may also contribute to
neurological prognosis, and further study is needed.

BACKGROUND: The Sturge-Weber syndrome is a sporadic congenital neurocutaneous
disorder characterized by a port-wine stain affecting the skin in the
distribution of the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve, abnormal capillary
venous vessels in the leptomeninges of the brain and choroid, glaucoma, seizures,
stroke, and intellectual disability. It has been hypothesized that somatic mosaic
mutations disrupting vascular development cause both the Sturge-Weber syndrome
and port-wine stains, and the severity and extent of presentation are determined 
by the developmental time point at which the mutations occurred. To date, no such
mutation has been identified.
METHODS: We performed whole-genome sequencing of DNA from paired samples of
visibly affected and normal tissue from 3 persons with the Sturge-Weber syndrome.
We tested for the presence of a somatic mosaic mutation in 97 samples from 50
persons with the Sturge-Weber syndrome, a port-wine stain, or neither (controls),
using amplicon sequencing and SNaPshot assays, and investigated the effects of
the mutation on downstream signaling, using phosphorylation-specific antibodies
for relevant effectors and a luciferase reporter assay.
RESULTS: We identified a nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variant (c.548G→A,
p.Arg183Gln) in GNAQ in samples of affected tissue from 88% of the participants
(23 of 26) with the Sturge-Weber syndrome and from 92% of the participants (12 of
13) with apparently nonsyndromic port-wine stains, but not in any of the samples 
of affected tissue from 4 participants with an unrelated cerebrovascular
malformation or in any of the samples from the 6 controls. The prevalence of the 
mutant allele in affected tissues ranged from 1.0 to 18.1%. Extracellular
signal-regulated kinase activity was modestly increased during transgenic
expression of mutant Gαq.
CONCLUSIONS: The Sturge-Weber syndrome and port-wine stains are caused by a
somatic activating mutation in GNAQ. This finding confirms a long-standing
hypothesis. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and Hunter's Dream for a
